# Airflow-Job-Posting-Pipeline
End-to-End ETL Pipeline using Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL & Docker

This project implements an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, and Docker to transform raw job posting data into a structured data warehouse using a star schema design.
The pipeline automates:
Table creation
Data transformation
Dimension loading
Fact table loading
Constraint enforcement
The system runs as a scheduled DAG and processes job posting data into analytics-ready tables.
